## How to Use This File
Add an entry every time you make a significant architectural, technology, or design decision.
Keep entries short — the goal is context, not documentation for its own sake.

---

## Template

### Decision: [Short Title]
- **Date:** [date]
- **Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Rejected
- **Context:** Why did this decision need to be made? What problem were you solving?
- **Options Considered:**
  1. Option A — [brief note]
  2. Option B — [brief note]
- **Decision:** Which option was chosen and why?
- **Consequences:** What does this make easier or harder going forward?

---

## Decisions

### Decision: Technology Stack Selection
- **Date:** ${today()}
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Need to choose the technology stack for a ${projectType} at ${stage} stage.
- **Options Considered:**
  1. ${data.stack[0] || "Option A"} — already familiar, lower learning curve
  2. Alternative — potentially better fit, but requires new learning
- **Decision:** Proceeding with ${stack}
- **Consequences:** Faster initial progress; may need to revisit if requirements change significantly.

- Project name and one-line description
- Problem statement (2–3 sentences)
- Proposed solution overview
- Your name and contact

> You do not need setup instructions, tech details, or deployment steps yet.
> Adding them now may confuse your proposal reviewers.`

- What this prototype demonstrates
- How to run it locally (simple steps)
- Known limitations and what's intentionally not implemented
- Next steps / validation goals`

- Project name and clear description
- Tech stack badge list
- Prerequisites and local setup instructions
- How to run tests
- Folder structure overview
- Contributing guidelines (if team project)
- Known issues or limitations
- License`
}

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Do not add a production deployment section if you're still in ${stage} stage
- Do not add a full API reference before your API is stable
- Keep the README under 500 lines unless the project is genuinely complex
${data.repoAnalysis ? `- Close the repo gaps first: ${data.repoAnalysis.missingSignals.join(", ") || "none"}` : ""}

## README Health Check
- [ ] Does the README explain what the project is in the first paragraph?
- [ ] Can a new person set up the project using only the README?
- [ ] Is the README accurate as of today?
